# Tidy SvelteKit Starter

A clean and minimal template for starting your next Sveltekit project.

## Preinstalled

- MDsevX (markdown formatting)
- Tailwind CSS (CSS framework), including plugins:
    - @tailwindcss/forms
    - @tailwindcss/typography

## Developing

You can choose to run using a Node.js or Bun runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> Running with Bun leverages all the advantages of Bun, however many production environments use a Node.js runtime. Therefore using/testing with Node.js may ensure your app remains Node friendly even when developed using Bun.

To use Bun:

```bash
bun --bun dev
```

Or to use Node.js:

```bash
bun dev
```
